# Golden Pancakes

These pancakes are golden in taste only. The brown sugar gives them a dark rich flavor that plays well with my recommended syrup. 
Super fluffy. Super derivitive. 

The steps are taken from another popular pancake recipe. 
Also, if its christmas, grate some nutmeg into the dry mixture. Be festive

## @steps
- @Prep
- In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and kosher salt.  
- In a separate bowl, whisk together buttermilk, egg, and melted butter.  
- Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients, pour the buttermilk mixture into it, and gently whisk until just combined - batter should still be lumpy.  
- Cover and let rest in the refrigerator for 30-60 minutes.
- @cook
- Spray a large cast iron or nonstick skillet with nonstick spray, and heat over medium-low heat, increasing to medium heat after 5 minutes.  
- Pour 1/8-1/4 cup batter (depending on how large you want your pancakes) onto the griddle, and cook for 1-3 minutes.  
- Once the edges of the pancake become dull and bubbles/holes form on the top of the pancake, check to make sure the bottom is brown, and flip, cooking for another 1-2 minutes.  
- If desired, place on a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet in a low (250Â°F) oven to keep warm.
