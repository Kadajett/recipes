## Housewares
4 small bowls for holding items

1 Kitchen aid mixer
1 Wooden spoon
1 Dessert Brush (for egg wash)
1 Fork
1 Clean towel for cooking
1 Plastic wrap 

## @steps
- @Prep the dough
- In one small bowl (Bowl 1), add 1 cup of water and then add the yeast.  
Add a tiny pinch of sugar to allow the yeast to eat it.
Put this bowl to the side for a few minutes which show allow for it to start producing bubbles (that means it's active, yay!)
- In one small bowl (Bowl 2), crack open 3 large eggs and scramble with a fork.
- In one small bowl (Bowl 3), melt the stick of butter.
- In a large bowl, add 4 cups of flour
- Add 1.5 tsp of salt slowly, making sure to mix with wooden spoon.
- Add 1/2 cup of sugar slowly, making sure to mix with wooden spoon.
- Add bowl 1, containing yeast water to the Large bowl that has the flour + sugar + salt mix. Mix with wooden spoon.
- Add bowl 2, containing the eggs and lightly mix with wooden spoon.
- Add bowl 3, containing the butter and lightly mix with wooden spoon.
- At this point you will have a dough that looks like a mash, that's ok.
- @Mix the dough
- Place mash contents into kitchen aid mixer withe the screw attachment.
- Secure and set the mixer to level 1
- Turn on your favorite song, cause it's time to wait a few minutes.
- Slowly add up to 1/2 cup - 3/4 cup flour.
- After about 15-20 min, your dough is ready to be risen.
- @Raise the dough
- Turn your oven on to 200 degrees F, as it pre-heats do the following:
- In a large clean bowl, greese with a dab of olive oil or any oil that won't leave a taste, but will prevent the dough from sticking to the bowl.
- Place mixed dough in.
- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap
- Use the fork to punch holes in the plastic wrap so your dough can breath, but not get out of the bowl.
- Take a clean kitchen towel and soak it in hot water and ring it.
- Cover the bowl that has the plastic wrap with lots of holes in it with the wet towel. (Plastic wrap prevents the dough from sticking to towel)
- Turn oven off. Heat will now reduce from 200 and down.
- Place the covered dough bowl in the degrading heat oven and turn on a timer for 3 hours.
- @Prepare dough for cooking
- After 3 hours, the oven will be cold/cool. This is expected.  Your dough should now be fully risen and fluffy.
- Spread a small amount of flour over a safe to work area / bread doard.
- Split dough into two parts.
- Split each part into 3 sub parts. Each smaller part will be a braid.
- For each braid, roll dough into your hand to make hair like dough strand.
- Once 3 braid strands are ready, braid them together.
- Do this for 2 loaves.
- Move the loaves onto cooking sheet.
- Crack open an egg into a small bowl (Bowl 4).  Scramble the egg with fork. For added fun, use small amount of interesting salt here.
- Use brush to paint the loaves with the egg wash.
