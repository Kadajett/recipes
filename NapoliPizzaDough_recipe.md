155 grams 00 flour
155 grams all purpose flour
8 grams of fine salt
2 grams active dry yeast
4 grams extra virgin olive oil
200 grams of lukewarm water

Step 1: Combine flours and salt in a stand mixing bowl or a large bowl
Step 2: in a small bowl, stir together water, yeast and oil
Step 3: pour your yeast mixture into your stand mixer with a dough hook and turn it on low until combined
Step 4: Scrape your dogh hook and cover the bowl for 15 minutes
Step 5: turn your stand mixer on low again and knead for 3-5 minutes
Step 6: Cut the dough in two and shape into balls
Step 7: if cooking the same day(not recommended): Cover in a damp cloth and let rise for 3-4 hours
        otherwise: oil two medium sized bowls and roll your dough balls around in them. Cover with platic wrap and let rise in your fridge for at least 18 hours. 
        
DONE! :) I recommend drizzling whatever pizza you make with a bit of olive oil AFTER you have finished baking. It will help to intensify all your flavors. :)
